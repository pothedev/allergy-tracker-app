## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### 1. **Bloom Prediction Model** – *(Random Forest Regression)*
- Predicts start/end bloom dates using historical pollen and weather
- Adjusts per region and year

### 2. **Two-Stage Pollen Intensity Model**
**Stage 1: Normal distribution**
- Creates a baseline intensity curve between predicted bloom start and end

**Stage 2: Real-time environmental adjustments**
- Inputs:
  - Temperature delta
  - Humidity
  - Rainfall
  - Cloud cover
  - Wind speed
  - CO₂ concentration
- Trained to apply realistic daily corrections to baseline (94% accuracy)

- **Open-Meteo** – Regional weather + location suggestions
- **OpenCageData** – Coordinate-to-city conversion
- **Breezometer** – Real-time pollen concentration and map tiles
- **Firebase** – Auth + secure storage of user data
